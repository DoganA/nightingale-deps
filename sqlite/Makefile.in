# This makefile is suppose to be configured automatically using the
# autoconf.  But if that does not work for you, you can configure
# the makefile manually.  Just set the parameters below to values that
# work well for your system.
#
# If the configure script does not work out-of-the-box, you might
# be able to get it to work by giving it some hints.  See the comment
# at the beginning of configure.in for additional information.

# The toplevel directory of the source tree.  This is the directory
